# Modified-NPuzzle
Suppose the standard n-puzzle problem is modified so that there are two empty locations (instead of
one) allowing you to pick any one tile adjacent to any one of the two empty locations and move it to
the adjacent empty location. You are given a starting configuration and are supposed to rearrange the
tiles by move them into the empty locations as necessary to end up in a given goal configuration.
Figure 1 shows an example of a starting and a goal configuration.
